## Dependencies
Please see the Dockerfile for the required versions of tools.

In general, the OpenRAM compiler has very few dependencies:
+ Git
+ Make
+ Python 3.6 or higher
+ Various Python packages (pip install -r requirements.txt)
+ Anaconda



## OpenRAM Library
OpenRAM is available as a Python library. There are a few ways to install it:

+ Install using Makefile (you need to clone the repo):
```
git clone git@github.com:VLSIDA/OpenRAM.git
cd OpenRAM
make library
```

+ Install the latest _dev_ version:
```
pip3 install git+https://git@github.com/VLSIDA/OpenRAM.git@dev
```



## Anaconda
We use Anaconda package manager to install the tools used by OpenRAM. This way, you don't have to
worry about updating/installing these tools. OpenRAM installs Anaconda silently in the background
(without affecting any existing anaconda setup you have).

OpenRAM uses Anaconda by default, but you can turn this feature off by setting `use_conda = False`
in your config file. Then, OpenRAM will use the tools you have installed on your system.

If you want to install Anaconda without running OpenRAM (for example to run unit tests, which do not install Anaconda), you can run:
```
cd OpenRAM
./install_conda.sh
```



## Docker (deprecated, use Anaconda instead)
We have a [docker setup](../../docker) to run OpenRAM. To use this, you should run:
```
cd OpenRAM/docker
make build
```
This must be run once and will take a while to build all the tools. If you have the
OpenRAM library installed, you can also run the docker setup from the package
installation directory.



## Environment

If you haven't installed the OpenRAM library or you want to use a different OpenRAM installation,
you can set two environment variables:
+ OPENRAM\_HOME should point to the compiler source directory.
+ OPENRAM\_TECH should point to one or more root technology directories (colon separated).

If you have the library installed and OPENRAM\_HOME set, the library will use the installation on
the OPENRAM\_HOME path.

If you don't have the library, you should also add OPENRAM\_HOME to your PYTHONPATH. This is not
needed if you have the library.

You can add these environment variables to your `.bashrc`:
```
  export OPENRAM_HOME="$HOME/OpenRAM/compiler"
  export OPENRAM_TECH="$HOME/OpenRAM/technology"
  export PYTHONPATH=$OPENRAM_HOME
```

Note that if you want symbols to resolve in your editor, you may also want to add the specific technology
directory that you use and any custom technology modules as well. For example:
```
  export PYTHONPATH="$OPENRAM_HOME:$OPENRAM_TECH/sky130:$OPENRAM_TECH/sky130/custom"
```

We include the tech files necessary for [SCMOS] SCN4M\_SUBM,
[FreePDK45]. The [SCMOS] spice models, however, are
generic and should be replaced with foundry models. You may get the
entire [FreePDK45 PDK here][FreePDK45].



## Sky130 Setup

To install [Sky130], you must have open\_pdks installed in $PDK\_ROOT. We highly recommend that you
use the version tagged in the Makefile as others have not been verified.
To install this automatically, you can run:
```
cd $HOME/OpenRAM
make pdk
```

Then you must also install the [Sky130] SRAM build space with the appropriate cell views into the OpenRAM technology directory
by running:
```
cd $HOME/OpenRAM
make install
```

You can also run these from the package installation directory if you have the OpenRAM library.
